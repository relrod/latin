# History of Rome

- Rome is said to have been founded on April 21, 753 BC
- Early Rome is considered to have been a kingdom.
  - It did, however, still have elements of popular government
  - The king was selected by a council (senātus) of elders (senēs)
  - The council was consulted on many matters of public policy
  - As Rome grew, the size of the senate increased
  - Popular assembly "comitia cūriāta" (assembly of cūriae)
    - The cūria being a group of families
    - The assembly voted on important issues like declaration of war
- Classes of people
  - patricians (patrēs) - old, original families
  - clientēs - strangers who came to Rome but did not have citizenship
    - Attached themselves to some "patrōnus" who looked after their rights and
      expected services in retrurn
  - plebeians (plēbēī) - general term for people not included in patrician group
    - Many were also not clientēs
  - slaves (servī)
    - Freed slaves became citizens but did not have rights of full citizenship
- A shift happened and the Roman Republic was formed.
  - The shift was brought on by two changes:
    1. People became tired of the one-man authority of kingship
    2. The plebeians wanted a larger share in the government

# The Roman Republic -- 509 - 31 BC

## The Citizens and Parties

- Officials were elected by popular assemblies
- The officials (magistrates - "magistrātūs') held office in pairs or groups
- Plebeians came to hold a relatively large share of the offices and gained
  rights earlier denied to them
- The distinction between patricians and plebeians never fully disappeared
  - However, plebeians had gained full political rights
- Laws provided that some magistrates (e.g. the tribunes of the people ("tribūnī
  plēbis") and at least one of the consuls) must be plebeians.
- Those who held rank of any curule magistracies (i.e. could sit in the curule
  chair of a magistrate) were known as "nōbilēs" and made up the "nōbilitās"
- Knights who did not hold curule offices were closely associated with the
  nōbilitās politically.
  - The two groups were called the "optimātēs" - the official or moneyed
    aristocracy.
- The rest of the people were called the "populārēs"
- The two parties (optimātēs and populārēs) each had leaders arise.
  - Also had clashes
- Foreigners secured citizenship by special grant.
- By Ciceo's time, the privilege of citizenship had been given to most of Italy.

## A small aside: Cicero

- Not a patrician
- Held all the most honorable magistracies
- Family belonged to the great middle class - the knights (equitēs)
  - Their property gained them position and influence in the state.

## The Magistrates

"Consuls, Dictator, Magister Equitum"
