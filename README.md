# latin

This repository contains my personal study of both Latin and Ancient Rome
(including the rise and fall of the Roman Empire).

This repository is for my own personal collection of notes, outlines, vocabulary
practice, and so on. Pull requests from outsiders are welcome if they fix
inaccuracies, but new information will be added by me (@relrod), since the goal
of this repository is to keep track of what I have learned (and, roughly, when).
